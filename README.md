1. Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Olist E-commerce dataset to uncover valuable business insights regarding customer behavior, seller performance, product categories, payment methods, and order values. The analysis was conducted using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
2. Datasets Used & Merging
The following datasets were used and merged to support the analysis:

- orders_dataset.csv
- order_items_dataset.csv
- order_payments_dataset.csv
- order_reviews_dataset.csv
- products_dataset.csv
- sellers_dataset.csv
- product_category_name_translation.csv

Merged datasets include:
- orders_and_orderpayments_merged_df
- orderitem_orderreview_merged_df
- merged_df (final dataset combining products, payments, reviews, and translations)
3. Business Questions Addressed
1. Which product categories generate the highest revenue?
2. What is the distribution of review scores, and how does it impact order volume and revenue?
